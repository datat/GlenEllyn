to the Bible, the church in any city is everyone in that city who has received
Jesus Christ as their Savior. Therefore, the church in Naperville includes every
believer who lives in Naperville. This is practical and real, like a family.
Instead of talking about the church theoretically or just one day a week, we
have decided to practice a church life as described in the Bible.</font></p>

<p><b><font size="6">Q.</font><font SIZE="5"> </font></b><font size="4">Is this
really possible?</font></p>
<p><b><font size="6">A. </font></b><font size="4">We believe the Lord is working
now to bring His believers into oneness. The first believers met in this way,
but this original practice of meeting simply as the church in a city was lost
and covered over by the many other ‘identities’ with which Christians have
come to associate themselves. We believe that a return to the original ground of
meeting together as the church in each city is doable. We believe it is possible
to meet together without any distinguishing titles or doctrines. We believe it
is not normal for believers to be divided from one another.</font></p>

receive all whom God receives, all who through faith have received Jesus, God’s
unique Son, as their Savior and thus as their life, regardless of their social
status, culture, nationality, etc.. We have no creed other than faith in Christ.
Such faith, as revealed in the Bible, assumes many things which we hold dear.
For example, Christ’s deity and humanity, His work of salvation on the cross,
His resurrection, and His ascension. Our primary concern is a relationship with
our living Lord and His Body, the church.</font></p>

someone meets with us, they will find us singing, praying and having fellowship
in homes or halls. It is our firm belief that each believer has a unique
function for the sake of the building up of the church, the Body of Christ. Just
as our physical body has many members with essential functions, so also does
Christ’s Body. We, the members of His Body, work with the Lord Himself to
build up one another. What a purpose! What a practice! What a privilege!</font></p>

          the 1920's, a few believers got together to break bread simply as the 
          church in their city. Since that time, believers in city after city 
          have come to experience the church life in this way — believing that 
          God has placed them together with one another in their city for a testimony 
          of oneness—just as the Lord Himself prayed in John 17:21-23. The choice 
          of <i>where </i>to meet is no longer an issue, for we recognize that 
          this choice has been taken out of our hands and placed firmly in His.</font></p>
